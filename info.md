### Q&A ###

1)  q) why is there Happyday and Sadday?
    a) Happyday is for easy and simple targets with low to no security. Sadday is for bigger and more secure companies.

2)  q) whats the logs for?
    a) The logs are to view the traffic and how the AntDDoS software held up.

3)  q) Is this legal?
    a) It depends, if you use it for malicious purposes yes, if you use it for fun and testing on your own controlled envirenment then no.

4)  q) how do i install?
    a) Install libs required, start the script and a UI should appear.


### Main Info ###

We have a selection of 2 of my best DDoS softwares, alongside with an AntiDDoS to see a ddos attack + anti ddos software in action. Yes, you could use it to take out major companies, but again, use it only for safe and permitted use.

Happyday is for websites using old HTTP or small wifi networks, due to its lack of script, cause i made it late at night and didnt put much work into it. Happyday is just a bunch of useragents and a simple flooder, not much else going on.

Sadday is for larger companies like big wifi networks, because it has IP spoofing, flood, you can only use IPs (maybe HTTPS might work, but i am still testing that feature). This one is more for testing your anti-ddos software as this program is way more realistic than happyday.

AntDDoS script is made to test your strength, it is mostly a base of what you want your ddos protection to be. Think of it as a Unity engine, it lets you build onto it. The script will log all the data being sent through in log txt files, and will show spikes and will live throttle the packets that seem suspicious. This code though cannot detect real IP source, because sadday builds the packet byte by byte leaving no trace of use of the real hackers IP.

TestWeb is a file i used chatgpt to generate which just lets me use as a test server when testing my software versions. It doesnt have much features, it only works like a logger.

User Agents file is just the user agents that i used in the scripts, it contains over 3000 different devices and when combined with IP spoofing, a DDoS attack with simulated botnet. Not a real botnet, but it commes close to what a real one is like, though in a real scenario the whole world would not be joining your mminecraft server lol.

Dont delete node_modules folder, they contain the libs needed to work, remember that.

### Disclaimer ###

Dont use this in illegal activity, because this is merely a fin project i made and i do not want it being used in large scaled attacks, i have too much on my hands right now so i dont need to be put in a court room with amazon beside me.

ONLY USE FOR LEGAL AND ETHICAL RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.
